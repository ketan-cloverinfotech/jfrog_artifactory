# What is JFrog Connect?

JFrog Connect (formerly Upswift.io) is a platform designed to manage Internet of Things (IoT) devices remotely. It focuses on making software updates (firmware, applications, configurations) and real-time monitoring easy and secure for connected devices. Below is a breakdown of what it is, why it’s useful, and some simple examples of how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.




**1.Remote Device Management:**

You can control and monitor all your IoT devices from one dashboard, whether they are Raspberry Pis, small embedded Linux boards, or other hardware.
“Remote” means you can perform tasks like updating firmware or restarting services on a device even if it’s thousands of miles away.

**2. Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:**

OTA updates allow you to push new software, patches, or firmware to devices without physically connecting to them.
This is vital for fixing bugs and improving features on deployed IoT devices in the field.



**3. Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:**

The platform monitors device health — for example, CPU usage, memory, and device temperature.
Set up notifications that alert you (by email or other channels) if a device goes offline or if resource usage crosses a certain threshold.


**4.Secure Communication and Management:**

Communication between your devices and the JFrog Connect platform is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
You can set different permission levels for your team members to limit who can perform critical operations.


**5.Scalability:**

Whether you’re managing 10 devices or 10,000 devices, JFrog Connect is designed to scale and handle fleets of devices without complex setup changes.
